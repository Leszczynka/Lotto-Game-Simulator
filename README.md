### General info
This project is a simple Lotto game simulator.
The user decides if he wants to play with random numbers or if he wants to enter his numbers. If the user chooses the first option, unique numbers between 1 and 49 will be drawn. Then the Lotto draw takes place - 6 numbers between 1 and 49 are drawn. Then we check if the user was lucky.

There are four winning grades:

I - if the count of matching numbers is 6

II - if the count of matching numbers is 5

III - if the count of matching numbers is 4

IV - if the count of matching numbers is 3

User receives information about the number of matching numbers and about the winning degree.
